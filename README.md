# Hangman Game
## https://hangman-game-sandy.vercel.app/
---
## A classic game with more than 1500 different words to guess
---
## I created this project to help some children who are learning to write in English, a great way to learn while having fun.
## I decided to expand it and add 2 more languages, Spanish and Italian, I'm working on it...
